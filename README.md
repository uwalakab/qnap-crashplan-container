# qnap-crashplan-container-update
Script for updating Crashplan Pro container on the QNAP NAS
Using the jlesage/crashplan-pro docker image on the QNAP NAS system running Container Station is a very effective (but un-supported) way of being able to backup data from shares on your NAS drive.

This script is created to automate and simplify the maintaining of the image and container used.
You barely need to interact with the Container Station GUI.
